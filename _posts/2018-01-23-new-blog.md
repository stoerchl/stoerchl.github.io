Welcome to my new tech blog!

{{more}}

<br/>About a year ago I created a twitter account. The reason i created an account was that many great cyber security personalities have one and share valuable information on it. As I started working in malware analysis and low level programming the information shared on twitter was very helpful to get to know e.g. how a malware can be analyzed.
<br/>For the past year I had absolutely no idea what I could post. I was quite new to malware analysis and had nothing really important to share. But recently I thought about what I am working at and thought, well I could share some stuff. It might not be new or even good but on the one hand it would be a good documentation for myself and on the other hand there is a possibility to find like minded people which would comment my stuff and give me advices on how to improve things.
<br/>Therefore you will probably find a few blog posts in the future about random stuff I like or am working at.
<br/>In my spare time I like to work on an Android security project, maintain and extend my own small analysis infrastructure and if the weather is good I love to go for a ride on my racing bicycle.
<br/>Cheers Storch
